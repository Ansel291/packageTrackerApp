# Package Tracker App

## Overview:

This is a CRUD React App which acts as a UI prototype for a company that wants to keep track of the status of their packages that is being shipped to their clients.

It easily allows the user to add new package orders, update the status, and delete packages once they have been delivered.

Users can create a new order by entering an order number, will be guided by form validation, can choose the item's status, add notes, check whether or not the order is on backorder, as well as update the status of the order, and delete the order.
